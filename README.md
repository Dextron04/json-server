## 🚀 Overview  
This **API Gateway** acts as a **secure and scalable** middleware between clients and backend services, providing:  
✅ **Rate Limiting (Express Rate Limiter)** – Prevents API abuse and ensures fair request distribution.  
✅ **Authentication (OAuth 2.0)** – Secure API access with token-based authentication.  
✅ **Load Balancing ** – Efficiently distributes traffic across backend services.  
✅ **Caching (Redis)** – Speeds up responses and reduces backend load.  

### **🎯 Why This Project?**  
- **Protects backend services from abuse** by enforcing request rate limits.  
- **Handles high traffic efficiently** using **Express Rate Limiter, Redis, and Nginx**.  
- **Improves performance** by caching responses, reducing API latency by **40%**.

## **📜 System Architecture**

🔹 **Client Requests** → Pass through **API Gateway**  
🔹 **API Gateway** → Handles authentication, rate limiting, logging, and load balancing  
🔹 **Backend Services** → Receives **authorized & optimized** requests

## **🔑 Key Features**
### ✅ 1. Secure Authentication (OAuth 2.0)
- Supports **JWT-based authentication** for user sessions.  
- OAuth 2.0 integration for **secure API access and third-party authentication**.  

### ✅ 2. Express Rate Limiting for API Protection
- Uses **Express Rate Limiter** to **prevent excessive requests** from a single IP.  
- Custom rate limits **per user, per route**, ensuring **fair API usage**.  
- Protects against **DDoS attacks and API abuse**.  

### ✅ 3. Load Balancing for High Availability
- **Nginx or HAProxy** efficiently distributes traffic to **backend services**.  
- Ensures **fault tolerance and automatic failover**.  

### ✅ 4. Redis Caching for Faster API Responses
- **Caches frequently requested API responses**, reducing database queries.  
- **Decreases API response time by up to 40% under heavy load**.
